## First Time Setup

Install [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/). It should handle setup `ruby` and `bun` for the project.

Run `bundle install` and `bun install` to install project dependencies.

Run `rails db:migrate` to setup your database for development.

`rails server` will start the development server. You can also use your favourite IDE to run a debugger.
